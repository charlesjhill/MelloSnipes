## Setting up Strapi
Once you clone the repository, to get the Strapi admin working you should ensure the following commands are ran:
1. First, make sure [npm/node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) are installed
2. In the Strapi folder (with the package.json file), run `npm install` from a console window to install all necessary dependencies
3. Run the command `npm run build` to build the admin page UI.
4. Run the command `npm run develop` to start the Strapi server locally in development mode
5. Open the browser to `localhost:1337/admin` to get started
